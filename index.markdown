There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating LLMs: *reference-based* evaluation looks at the performance at well-defined single-shot tasks like question answering or summarisation; while *preference-based* evaluation asks users to interact with such two such models (each interfaced as a potentially multi-turn chatbot) in parallel and to judge which one "performs better".

We propose **a complementary way of evaluating LLMs** which combines the control (and reproducibility that comes from automation) that reference-based evaluation offers with the interactivity challenged in chatbot-type preferential evaluation. This is achieved **through *gameplay* in well-defined conversational / dialogue games**. We have implemented a set of games (such as Wordle or Taboo, or games where one player must formulate descriptions of what to do to another player) which current models can play *in self-play*. These games come with metrics that measure the quality of the game play. Together, across the set of games, we can calculate an overal score per model (what we call the *clemscore*) which serves as an indicator of how well the model can follow fine-grained instructions and how well it can simulate goal-directed conversational behaviour.

The framework for implementing such games and for running the overall benchmark [is described in the code repo](https://github.com/clembench/clembench). The implemented games that form the current version of the *clembench* are described in the paper. Here, you can find the results of running the collection of games that forms the current version of the *clembench* against the list of models shown below. 

We are continuously updating the leaderboard with new models; and, less often, the benchmark with additional games. Check back often to see the latest version.
